# BEMT.jl

## Description

This package provides a basic implementation of Blade Element Momentum Theory for the analysis of rotors and propellers. It has been designed to support the delivery of the Integrated Project (Level 2) as part of the Aerospace Engineering Programme at the University of Nottingham. Thus, the target users for this package are Aerospace students at Nottingham. However, the code has been released with an MIT license so the wider public can use freely and are welcome to
